(Note: Useful when the decrease value is 0 to\n      force the other team to drop it down to zero before gaining any control).\n      Capturing is when a team is actively driving the percentage in their favor.\n      Contested is when multiple teams are on the point forcing the point to contention\n      based on the rules defined. Reseting is when the point has no one on it\n      and has the ability to drive the percentage back to zero.\n\n      Contention Rules: Currently there are two types of contention rules and it\n      isn't hard to add more in the future. MajorityWins (default) is where the\n      difference between multiple teams is the number of capturers and when an\n      even number are present the point is in contention. (Note: This setup actually\n      handles N teams where the team with the most and the team with the second\n      most affect the difference, i.e. Team1 = 2, Team2 = 1, Team3 = 1 then Team1\n      is capturing with a count of 1). OneTeamOnlyWins is where only 1 team can\n      be present on the point at a time to actually capture it.\n\n      Unlock Rules: Once the point is locked and the time interval is through and\n      unlocks the point there are a couple of rules that govern how the point behaves.\n      ResetState will remove the team that is controlling the point and reset all\n      values to 0 so capturing can begin from the beginning again.

This gives aim assist users an inhuman advantage:\n       * They acquire targets accidentally when they happen to appear around corners\n       * They keep their aim on targets impossibly well when they appear, change movement direction, or when a closer target dies\nTherefore, this \"robotic\" aim assist keeps players' aim on targets longer, meaning they land more shots and do damage in a way that\nis impossible for players who don't use aim assist (mainly mouse, but also gyro).\n\nThis puts us in the impossible position of making aim assist weak enough that its robotic effects don't feel unfair, but strong enough\nto help players (particularly new players) enjoy the game with a controller.\n\n\"Humanlike\" aim assist (as opposed to the \"robotic\" standard) models a human reaction time very simply, letting us tune competitive fairness\n(modelled reaction time) mostly separately from player comfort (aim assist strength). Like humans do, humanlike aim assist predicts the\ntarget's current position and velocity from older information. That prediction reaction time, and the time windows over which target velocity\nand acceleration, can be tuned with the CVars:\n       AimAssist2D.ReactionTime,\n       AimAssist2D.VelocityEstimationDelta,\n       AimAssist2D.UseEstimatedAcceleration, and\n       AimAssist2D.PredictDeadTargets.\n\nThey are all inactive unless:\n       * AimAssist2D.ReactionTime > 0, and\n       * the rollback AimAssistModelsHumanReactionTime is enabled\n\nThis rollback is disabled for now but can be enabled at any time for testing.\n\nThe meat of the implementation is in GetPredictedPosition, which tracks a target's historical position and uses that to predict a current\nposition and velocity. This could also be used for beginner-friendly auto-aim systems (high reaction time = low competitiveness) and\nbots (tune reaction time for difficulty; let typical human-against-human movement strategies perform well against bots).\n=============================================================================//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n// FFortAimAssist2D_InputParams\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////",

    "FortAthenaMutator_RespawnAndSpectateSelect": "Mutator that shows a UI menu where dead players can choose to spectate respawn targets and choose which respawn target to respawn near.\n\nThis mutator keeps a list of Respawn Targets which are actors where players can respawn at. Normally players can respawn on any enabled respawn target that their team has access to, and there is no limit to how many players can respawn at one respawn target.\nRespawn targets can be added/removed at anytime.\nRespawn targets must be added on the server, there are 2 ways to add them:\n 1) By turning on flags like bAllowRespawnOnLivingTeammates and bAllowRespawnOnLivingSquadmates which will automatically generate specific respawn targets,\n 2) By manually adding respawn locations using AddRespawnTargetData()\nOnce added respawn targets persist until the game is over or they are manually removed from the server by calling: RemoveRespawnTargetData()\n\nTo use this mutator you will need to add a widget derived from RespawnAndSpectateContainerWidget to the Playlist. This widget will act as the UI for this mutator.\n\nYou can implemenmt special respawning location/transform rules by making a class implement IRespawnAndSpectateSelectManager and then using SetManager() to set it to manage this class\n\nWhen implementing this class you will probably want to use AddRespawnTargetData() to add at least 1 default respawn target for each team at all times. This respawn target can be shared among all teams or it can be specific to 1 team.\nMultiple default respawn targets are possible, but not advised (there is no randomization so one would become the effective default while the other might never get used that way).\nThe default respawn target should be a replicated and always relevant actor that is at a location it is always viable for a player of the corresponding team to respawn at.\nThe default respawn target is set by using AddRespawnTargetData(InputData) where InputData.bShouldBeSelectedByDefault == true.\nThe default respawn target is used:\n    1) to set the player's spectate target if they do NOT have a spectate target or the player's spectate target has becomes invalid (this often happens with player disconnects/death).\n 2) when the player has waited on the respawn screen so long that they are forced to respawn, if they do NOT have a valid spectate target they will respawn at the default respawn target.\n\n   NOTE: The console command cheat \"RespawnScreenToggleMakeAllRespawnTargetsAvailableToAllPlayers\" is very useful for testing. It makes the screen function correctly with just 1 player where normally you would need multiple players on 1 squad or 1 team.",

It may make sense to have multiple schemes here. But this focuses on choosing from a selection of augments.\n                Decoupling means if players obtaining augments via a boss drop in the world, picking up that augment will be separate from this granting management.\n                Decoupling means we can have weighted loot tables making augments available, or something else entirely providing the selection of augments available.\n                The spytech system was previous investigated for augments, but found that the coupling to round based granting logic made it less flexible (there were other issues as well, such as the type of items spytech was).\n                Decoupling means creative can leverage augments without the granting logic; since they will be using their own custom logic.\n        negatives:\n                it might be slightly more involved to figure out what you need to modify if a change is needed (but I think it shouldn't be too bad, as this keeps classes small).\n                we have multiple components where as we could have only 1 without decoupling.\n                it could get involved if different components have bad interactions, and need to make components interact with each other (realistically though I think not, since granting augment is done via inventory, these components will hopefully be mutually exclusive).\n.",
